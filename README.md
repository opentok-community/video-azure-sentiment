# Video Azure Sentiment Analysis

This sample application can be used to create an OpenTok video session with multiple participants. Each
participant will display in a different panel. Any participant can click the "Analyze" button to submit
the other participants to the Azure Face API to determine their sentiment. Once Face API returns the request
an emoji will be added to the participants video panel denoting their sentiment.

### OpenTok Session ID & Token

To generate an OpenTok Session ID & Token, log into your [TokBox Account], and either create
a new project or use an existing project. Then go to your project page and scroll down to the
**Project Tools** section. From there, you can generate a session ID and token manually. Use the
projectâ€™s API key along with the session ID and token you generated.

**Important notes:**

- You can continue to get the session ID and token values from your Account during testing and
  development, but before you go into production you must set up a server. To learn more,
  visit [OpenTok Basics](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/basics/) in the Developer Documentation.
